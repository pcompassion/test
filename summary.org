** accounting
- double entry booking system
- credit / debit on accounting ledger
  - debit means plus, credit means minus
  - it doesn't mean asset is increasing, it depends on what account the ledger is about
    if it's liability ledger, debit means increasing liability
- liability
  usually means the future obligation for minus action
  which isn't incurred at the time of recording the entry
  - bank's checking account is an asset to a customer, and a liability to the bank
    certain portion of the amount are immediate liability, because bank is obligated to give up immediately when required
- receivable / payable
  signifies it's plus / minus in the future
- expense account
  It's a placeholder that records spending that does not result in asset increase
  For example, when you take a bus, the spending is gone

  Note that we are balancing debit / credit with hypothetical placeholder entry and keeping the double entry requirements.
  Even though we are keeping it balanced, the system interprets such hypothetical entry and is closed out to retained earnings in a permanent equity account

  By recording both debit/credit required by double entry booking system, it enforces to record how those changes (here expenses) afftected the inflow / outflow from the accounting entity and the outside world

  The non existing change (debit or credit) is called paper changes

** Money creation by FR

- goverment issues bonds (i need money)
- bonds is auctioned
- commercial banks or FR buys the bonds
- when FR buys bonds, (they typically buy through commercial banks)
  their accounting ledger has
  - purchased bond as debit
  - purchase money to the commercial bank as credit
  - this purchased money has no source, it's not deducted from an another existing account
    so this effectively creates money out of thin air
